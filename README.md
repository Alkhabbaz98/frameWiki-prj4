<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>

<hr>
<p>FrameWiki is a small web project designed to help users explore and document fighting game characters and their moves. Users can browse through different games, view each character’s move list, and add, edit, or delete moves. This project serves as a simple database-driven wiki that keeps track of move data such as damage values and other properties.</p>

<h1>Project's Technological Content</h1>

<p>The main technology used in this project is Django, a Python-based web framework. Django was used to build the backend, define the models for Game, Character, and Move, and manage all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for moves.
<br>
<br>
PostgreSQL(PGAdmin) was used as the database to store all data related to games, characters, and moves. Queries can be run and tested using pgAdmin.
<br>
<br>
HTML templates were used to build the structure of the web pages. Django’s template system allowed for dynamic content, such as rendering a character’s move list or showing forms to create and edit moves.
<br>
<br>
CSS was used to add styling and improve the appearance of the pages. It provided layout control and visual formatting for the forms, lists, and navigation.</p>

<h1>Improvements for The Future </h1>

<p>FrameWiki can be improved in many ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making the website content and pages allowed to be visited without making an account but limited for moves crud</li>

<li>Adding a search bar and a filter</li>

<li>Add a feature when you can compare characters tools against each other</li>

<li>Filtering the characters when submiting a move based on their game</li>
</ul>
